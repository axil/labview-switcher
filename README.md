# python-alttab

In Labview it is difficult to switch out of Labview documents to for example a browser 
when many vi files are open, because it breaks standard Alt-Tab sequence.

This script lets you switch to the browser (ie Most Recently Used non-labview window) 
using one keypress (Alt-` by default).

## Installation

1. Install any recent python 2.x or 3.x
2. Install Autohotkey
3. Double-click switch.ahk

## Usage

Press Alt-` (Alt-backtick) to switch to the previous window.
